# No Global Warrants

[Noglobalwarrants.org](https://noglobalwarrants.org) is a coalition of technology companies, civil liberties organizations, and users concerned about the threats to privacy and security posed by changes to Rule 41.  This site provides info about Rule 41's expansion of US government hacking powers, and allows users to speak out to policymakers.

You can join the movement to stop these changes by embedding https://github.com/EFForg/ngw-banner/ on any website.  Please email activism@eff.org if you would like to add your organization to [Noglobalwarrants.org](https://noglobalwarrants.org).
